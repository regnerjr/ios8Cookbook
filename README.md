Welcome: 

I have been taking a look at the iOS8 Programming Cookbook by Vandad
Nahavandipoor. The book is really great, but I wanted to take the opportunity to
learn by doing. (Also the book uses `setFrame:` in a lot of places and I wanted
to take the chance to improve my autolayout skills.

1.1 BlurEffects - I put 2 chunks of sample code in here. One shows how to set up
a simple BlurView, the other a Vibrancy Effect with a label.
